Here, taxpayers’ income is categorised as ranges or slabs and certain tax rates are assigned to them. This is a progressive system of taxation where people earning more income are taxed at higher income tax slabs in proportion to their higher income. By introducing income tax slabs in India, the Government of India aims to achieve a fair taxation system for all citizens. With this aim, the government revises the tax slabs periodically and announces amendments to the Union Budget accordingly. Now that you know what income tax slabs are, let's take you through the different slabs under the old and new tax regimes for a better understanding. For several years, many people purchased life insurance simply as a tax-saving method. The truth is, life insurance plays a crucial role in every sound financial plan. Before we create financial plans for the upcoming financial year, let’s better understand the new rules and regulations. In February 2023, the finance minister outlined the budget for the upcoming year, which included a few changes to the new tax regime. The finance minister reduced the number of tax slabs and extended the standard deduction to the salaried class and pensioners as well. Below, we have provided a detailed understanding of the income tax slab rates for the Financial Year 2025-26 (Assessment Year 2026-27). New Tax Regime The new tax regime, introduced by the finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, offers concessional tax rates with limited exemptions and deductions. As per Budget 2025, taxpayers with incomes up to Rs. 12 lakh will get a rebate of Rs. 60,000, effectively bringing their tax liability to zero. The revised income tax slabs are as follows: Annual Income Tax Rate Up to Rs. 4,00,000 0% Rs. 4,00,001 – Rs. 8,00,000 5% Rs. 8,00,001 – Rs. 12,00,000 10% Rs. 12,00,001 – Rs. 16,00,000 15% Rs. 16,00,001 – Rs. 20,00,000 20% Rs. 20,00,001 – Rs. 24,00,000 25% Rs. 24,00,001 and above 30% Old Tax Regime The old tax regime continues to offer various exemptions and deductions. The income tax slab for FY 2025-26 is: Annual Income (Rs. ) Tax Rate (%) Up to 2,50,000 NIL 2,50,001 – 5,00,000 25 5% 5,00,001 – 10,00,000 20% 10,00,001 and Above- 30% Note : Senior citizens (60-80 years) have a basic exemption limit of Rs. 3 lakh, and super senior citizens (above 80 years) have Rs. 5 lakh. Quick glance at the latest Income Tax Slabs for FY 2025-26 & AY 2026-27 after budget 2025 The following table gives an overview of the latest income tax slabs in India after the budget 2025 announcement for FY 2025-26 (AY 2026-27): Taxable Income New Tax Rate Old Tax Rate Up to Rs. 2,50,000 0% 0% Rs. 2,50,001 - Rs. 4,00,000 0% 5% Rs. 4,00,001 – Rs. 5,00,000 5% 5% Rs. 5,00,001 - Rs. 8,00,000 5% 20% Rs. 8,00,001 – Rs. 10,00,000 10% 20% Rs. 10,00,001 - Rs. 12,00,000 10% 30% Rs. 12,00,001 – Rs. 15,00,000 15% 30% Rs. 15,00,001 - Rs. 16,00,000 15% 30% Rs. 16,00,001 – Rs. 20,00,000 20% 30% Rs. 20,00,001 – Rs. 24,00,000 25% 30% Rs. 24,00,001 and above 30% 30% Here are a few key highlights to glance through about the latest income tax slab rates: Default Option The new tax regime remains the default choice, but individuals without business income can opt for the old regime each financial year. Higher Basic Exemption Limit: In case of New Tax Regime, Basic Exemption limit raised from Rs. 3 lakh to Rs. 4 lakh effective April 1, 2025, offering greater tax relief. Enhanced Section 87A Rebate: Taxpayers with incomes up to Rs. 12 lakh will get a rebate of Rs. 60,000, effectively bringing their tax liability to zero. Standard Deduction: Salaried employees are eligible for a standard deduction of Rs. 75,000, increasing the tax-free income threshold to Rs. 12.75 lakh. No Change in Surcharge: The highest surcharge rate of 37% has been reduced to 25% under the New Tax regime . Tax Savings: - Taxable income of Rs. 12 lakh : No tax under the New tax regime vs. Rs. 1,63,800 under the Old tax regime . - Taxable income of Rs. 15 lakh : Rs. 97,500 under the new regime tax vs. Rs. 2,57,400 under the old regime – saving Rs. 1,59,900. - Taxable income of Rs. 25 lakh : Rs. 3,19,800under the New tax regime vs. Rs. 5,69,400 under the Old tax regime – saving Rs. 2,49,600. Impact : These updates simplify the tax structure and boost disposable income, especially benefiting middle-income earners. Let's Better Understand the Income Tax Slabs Under the Union Budget FY 2025-26 (AY 2026-27) The Union Budget 2025 focused on simplifying the income tax system and boosting taxpayer savings through higher rebates and streamlined slabs. Here's a closer look at the major updates: Increased Rebate: Taxpayers with an annual income of up to Rs. 7 lakh continue to get a full tax rebate under Section 87A. However, with the revised slabs and deductions, individuals earning up to Rs. 12 lakh may now have zero tax liability under the new tax regime, depending on salary structure and eligible benefits. Standard Deduction: Under the new tax regime, salaried individuals and pensioners can claim a flat Rs. 75,000 standard deduction, enhancing tax savings without any investment conditions. Simplified Slabs The new regime continues with a granular slab structure, featuring lower tax rates for each income bracket. This eases the burden on middle-class taxpayers and promotes transparency in the tax system. Comparison of Tax Rates under New Tax Regime and Old Tax Regime for FY 2026-26 (AY 2026-27) The following is a comparative table related to tax rates under the new tax regime and the old tax regime for FY 2025-26: Taxable Income New Tax Rate Old Tax Rate Up to Rs. ,2,50,000 0% 0% Rs. 2,50,001 - Rs. 4,00,000 0% 5% Rs. 4,00,001 – Rs. 5,00,000 5% 5% Rs. 5,00,001 - Rs. 8,00,000 5% 20% Rs. 8,00,001 – Rs. 10,00,000 10% 20% Rs. 10,00,001 - Rs. 12,00,000 10% 30% Rs. 12,00,001 – Rs. 15,00,000 15% 30% Rs. 15,00,001 - Rs. 16,00,000 15% 30% Rs. 16,00,001 – Rs. 20,00,000 20% 30% Rs. 20,00,001 – Rs. 24,00,000 25% 30% Rs. 24,00,001 and above 30% 30% Please note that the new regime offers lower rates for middle-income brackets but limits exemptions and deductions. Example of Old Tax Regime vs. New Tax Regime: To help you better understand how the old and new tax regimes impact your tax liability, let us consider a simple example Scenario : An individual with a gross annual income of Rs. 15,00,000. Old Tax Regime Calculation: This regime allows several deductions and exemptions that help reduce taxable income. Deductions Claimed: Section 80C (e.g., PPF, ELSS, LIC Premium): Rs. 1,50,000 Section 80D (Medical Insurance Premium): Rs. 25,000 Standard Deduction (for salaried individuals): Rs. 50,000 Net Taxable Income : Rs. 15,00,000 – Rs. 2,25,000 = Rs. 12,75,000 Income Tax Computation: Rs. 2,50,001 – Rs. 5,00,000 @ 5% = Rs. 12,500 Rs. 5,00,001 – Rs. 10,00,000 @ 20% = Rs. 1,00,000 Rs. 10,00,001 – Rs. 12,75,000 @ 30% = Rs. 82,500 Total Tax : Rs. 1,95,000 Add: Health & Education Cess (4%): Rs. 7,800 Total Tax Liability : Rs. 2,02,800 New Tax Regime Calculation: This regime offers lower tax rates but fewer deductions. Only the standard deduction of Rs. 75,000 is applicable. Net Taxable Income: Rs. 15,00,000 – Rs. 75,000 = Rs. 14,25,000 Income Tax Computation (As per FY 2025-26 slabs): Rs. 4,00,001 – Rs. 8,00,000 @ 5% = Rs. 20,000 Rs. 8,00,001 – Rs. 12,00,000 @ 10% = Rs. 40,000 Rs. 12,00,001 – Rs. 14,25,000 @ 15% = Rs. 33,750 Total Tax: Rs. 93,750 Add: Health & Education Cess (4%): Rs. 3,750 Total Tax Liability : Rs. 97,500 In this scenario, the new tax regime results in significantly lower tax liability compared to the old regime. While the old regime benefits those with high deductions, the new regime is more tax-efficient for individuals with fewer deductions. Always evaluate based on your actual eligible deductions before choosing. Deductions and Exemptions Under the New Tax Regime The new tax regime as per Budget 2025 aims to simplify tax filing by removing most exemptions and deductions. However, a few key deductions are still allowed: Standard Deduction: Salaried individuals and pensioners can now claim a higher standard deduction of Rs. 75,000, up from Rs. 50,000 in the previous year. This helps reduce taxable income under the income tax slab for FY 2025-26. Employer’s Contribution to NPS for the benefit of employee [Section 80CCD(2)]: 10% of Salary(14% for government employees) or Employer’s Contribution whichever is higher, is allowed as a deduction , offering a tax-efficient retirement benefit. Section 80JJAA: Available for businesses hiring new employees, encouraging job creation. Section 80CCH(2): Allows deduction on contributions made to the Agniveer Corpus Fund by Agniveers. Additionally, the surcharge rates remain capped at 25% for income above Rs. 2 crore under the new tax regime. Though limited, these deductions still offer smart tax planning opportunities within the revised income tax slab rates. How to Determine Which Income Tax Slab Applies to You? Determining your applicable income tax slab for FY 2025-26 begins with calculating your gross income, which includes earnings from salary, business/profession, house property, capital gains, and other sources. Next, evaluate the deductions and exemptions you are eligible for. Under the old tax regime, you could claim deductions like Section 80C, 80D, HRA, and LTA. The new tax regime, however, allows fewer deductions but offers lower tax rates and a higher standard deduction of Rs. 75,000. Once deductions are considered, compute your taxable income by subtracting eligible deductions from gross income. Then, match this figure with the latest tax slabs as per the regime you choose. Additionally, factors like your age category (general, senior, or super senior citizen), source of income, and long-term tax planning goals should be weighed when selecting the appropriate regime. A tax calculator can help simplify this decision-making process and ensure optimal tax savings. Different Types of Taxable Income in India To calculate income tax in India, the taxpayers’ sources of income are categorised into different groups. The five main heads of taxable income in India are as follows. Income from Salaries The income which an employee receives from an employer is categorised under this head. Even the pension a person receives after retirement is also categorised under this section. Form 16 carries every detail of your income from salaries. While filing your taxes, consider submitting this form as proof of your income and employment. Income from Business or Profession According to Sections 30 to Section 43D of the Income Tax Act , the income a person earns from sources like freelancing, business or professions is taxable under this head. Income from such professions or side hustles is categorised under this head. Income from House Property Any income that an individual makes by renting, leasing or selling a residential property is taxable by the Income Tax Act under this category. Income from Capital Gains This category considers the earnings that you make from sources like investments in capital assets. This can include mutual funds, real estate and stocks. This section also divides your capital gains into two major categories based on your holding period. These are long-term capital gains (LTCG) and short-term capital gains (STCG). Income from Other Sources Lastly, any income that does not fall under the above four categories is taxed as income from other sources. Examples of income sources that belong to this category are as follows. Gifts received from any TV show or programme Interests on FDs, saving bank accounts, etc Interests from securities, bonds and debentures Income from dividends Profits from gambling, horse races and lotteries Gifts from friends and families Pension a person receives after pensioner’s death Rental income from properties used for non-residential purposes How to Calculate Income Tax with Tax Slabs? Calculating income tax involves a few simple steps that are discussed below: Determine Taxable Income: Start by subtracting eligible deductions (like standard deduction, Section 80C, etc.) from your gross total income to arrive at your taxable income. Apply Slab Rates: Based on the tax regime you choose (old or new), apply the applicable slab rates to the respective portions of your income. Add Cess: Once the basic tax is calculated, add 4% Health and Education Cess to it. Total Tax Liability: Combine the calculated tax and cess to find your total payable amount. What is a Surcharge and what are the Rates? A surcharge is an additional tax levied on the income tax amount (not on the total income) of individuals earning above certain thresholds. It is applicable primarily to high-income taxpayers and is aimed at ensuring a fair contribution from the ultra-rich. For FY 2025-26 (AY 2026-27), the applicable surcharge rates under the old and new tax regimes are: 10% on income tax if the total income exceeds Rs. 50 lakh but does not exceed Rs. 1 crore 15% on income tax if the total income exceeds Rs. 1 crore but does not exceed Rs. 2 crore 25% on income tax if income exceeds Rs. 2 crore but does not exceed Rs. 5 crore 37% on income tax if income exceeds Rs. 5 crore under the old regime Note : Under the new tax regime, the surcharge is capped at 25%, even for incomes above Rs. 5 crore, providing some relief to high earners. Always consider the surcharge impact while planning taxes under either regime. Important Points to Consider When Selecting the New Tax Regime When deciding between the new income tax regime and the old one for FY 2025-26 (AY 2026-27), it is crucial to weigh key differences in deductions, rebates, and overall tax liability. Below are some essential factors to keep in mind: Limited Deductions and Exemptions The new tax regime offers lower income tax slab rates, but significantly limits deductions. Over 70 exemptions and deductions, including those under Section 80C (like ELSS, PPF, life insurance premiums), Section 80D (health insurance), HRA, and LTA, are not applicable. This makes the new regime ideal for individuals who do not have many investments or claims. Enhanced Standard Deduction A key benefit introduced in Budget 2025 is the increased standard deduction of Rs. 75,000 (up from Rs. 50,000 in FY 2024-25) for salaried and pensioned individuals. This deduction is automatically applied and provides basic relief even without any additional investments. Section 87A Rebate Expansion Under the revised structure, individuals with income up to Rs. 12 lakh may effectively pay zero tax after considering the standard deduction, lower tax rates, and the enhanced Section 87A rebate Surcharge Cap The maximum surcharge under the new regime is capped at 25%, ensuring more predictable tax outgo for high-income earners. Uniform Applicability Unlike the old regime, the new tax slabs apply uniformly across all age groups, general, senior, and super senior citizens, offering a simplified structure. Also, use an online income tax calculator to evaluate which tax regime suits your financial profile best before filing. Key Highlights of the New Income Tax Regime for FY 2025-26 The following are a few highlights to look at related to the latest tax slab as per the 2025 Budget: Default Regime: The new tax regime is now the default option for all taxpayers unless they specifically opt for the old regime while filing returns. Standard Deduction: Salaried individuals and pensioners are eligible for a standard deduction of Rs. 75,000 under New tax regime, offering direct relief from taxable income. Simplified Slabs: The regime features seven income tax slabs with lower tax rates, simplifying calculations and reducing overall tax burden. No Major Deductions Allowed: Common exemptions and deductions, such as Section 80C (investments), 80D (health insurance), and HRA, are not applicable under New tax regime . Higher Rebate Limit: Section 87A rebate has been enhanced, effectively eliminating tax liability for individuals with income up to Rs. 12 lakh who has opted for New tax regime, subject to conditions. Reduced Surcharge: The maximum surcharge is capped at 25%, lowering the effective tax rate for high-income earners under New Tax Regime. Pensioners’ Relief: A deduction of Rs. 25,000 or 1/3rd of family pension (whichever is less) continues to be allowed. Consequences of Missing the Filing Deadline for FY 2025-26 & AY 2026-27 Filing your Income Tax Return (ITR) on or before the due date is not just a formality—it has financial and legal implications. Here's what could happen if you miss the deadline for FY 2025-26 (AY 2026-27): 1. Interest and Penalties As per Section 234A of the Income Tax Act, interest at 1% per month or part thereof is levied on any unpaid tax amount from the due date until the date of filing. Additionally, under Section 234F, a late filing fee of Rs. 5,000 is applicable if the return is filed after the due date but before 31st December 2026. If your total income is below Rs. 5 lakh, the penalty is reduced to Rs. 1,000. 2. Inability to Carry Forward Losses If you miss the deadline, you cannot carry forward losses under the head “Capital Gains” or “Business and Profession” to offset against future income. However, loss from house property can still be carried forward. 3. Restriction on Choosing Tax Regime Taxpayers with business income are required to declare their preferred regime (new or old) in their return. Filing late could restrict your ability to opt or switch to old tax regimes, potentially increasing your tax liability. 4. Legal Consequences In serious cases of willful default, Section 276CC allows for prosecution, with imprisonment ranging from 3 months to 7 years, along with fines. Please note that the last date to file the return for FY 2025-26 is 31st July 2026 (non-audit cases). Belated returns can be filed by 31st December 2026 with applicable penalties. Summary The Union Budget 2025 has refined and simplified the personal income tax regime for FY 2025-26 (AY 2026-27). With increased standard deductions, restructured slab rates, and capped surcharges, the new regime aims to ease tax compliance while offering fair relief to middle and upper-middle-class taxpayers. Choosing between the old and new regime depends on your income structure and eligible deductions, so evaluate both carefully before filing your return. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) 1.

FAQs on What is Annuity If you are wondering what is annuity , it is a financial product that provides an individual with a steady income after their retirement by converting their savings into a regular payout system. After investing a lump sum or recurring premiums, the investor receives guaranteed payments, either immediately or after a period, depending on the annuity type. This helps you manage your post-retirement expenses and maintain financial independence in your golden years, making it a crucial part of a well-rounded retirement plan. An annuity plan has two phases: ● Accumulation Phase – where you invest regularly or as a lump sum. ● Distribution (Vesting) Phase – where you begin receiving regular income upon reaching a certain age. Different types of annuities include: ● Immediate annuity: Starts income right after you invest a lump sum. ● Deferred annuity: Income begins after a future date, making it ideal for long-term planning. ● Fixed annuity: Offers guaranteed, stable payouts. ● Market-linked annuity: Income depends on investment performance and suits those open to higher returns with some risk. For instance, if you invest Rs. 10 lakh in an annuity plan at age 60, you could start receiving a monthly pension of around Rs. 6,000 to Rs. 7,000, depending on the plan type and annuity rate. You can further customise annuities for lifetime income, joint payouts with a spouse, or return of premium to nominees, along with your financial goals, such as for a specific term or get it as a lifetime income. This financial plan is ideal for retirees, self-employed individuals, or anyone seeking stable post-retirement income annuities to help combat longevity risk and inflation. Moreover, the income you receive from an annuity is generated through: ● Interest earned on fixed-income investments (for fixed annuities) ● Returns from market-linked instruments such as equities and debt funds (in case of variable or ULIP-based annuities) Up next, we will explore in detail how annuities actually work, their types and benefits, and more. How Do Annuities Work? An annuity contract offers you a guaranteed stream of income after your retirement. This process is segregated into two main phases. The details are below: 1. Accumulation Phase - When You Pay You have two options to purchase an annuity plan. They are- - By investing a lump sum amount as a part of an immediate annuity plan. - Through regular premium payment as a part of a deferred annuity plan. In this phase, the annuity insurance provider invests your contribution in fixed-income assets or any market-linked instruments. Over time, your investment starts growing with the help of compound interests. For instance, if you invest Rs. 10 lakh at an 8% annual return in a deferred annuity, your corpus can grow to over Rs. 21.5 lakh in 10 years. You can easily use a retirement calculator to determine the optimal amount to invest. 2. Distribution Phase - When You Receive the Income When an individual reaches the vesting age (generally 60 years), the financial institution or the insurance company starts paying a fixed income, either monthly, quarterly, or annually, for life or a set tenure. For example, under the HDFC Life Smart Pension Plus scheme, you can opt for a life annuity with a return of premium where your nominee gets the premium back after your demise ( HDFC Life Smart Pension Plus ). It is critical to understand that annuity providers, such as HDFC Life, offer a stable and lifelong income option, regardless of any market conditions. This helps in making annuity planning a reliable pillar for retirement savings plans . Show Full Article Hide Full Article A Plan for your every need What is your first name?

Read below to understand the key features of annuity before investing in one: ● Guaranteed Regular Income Annuities provide a predictable stream of income that is paid either monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or yearly, as per your needs and financial goals. It ensures that you do not have to worry about changing market returns after your retirement. Also, your payout remains steady regardless of how the market cycle changes. ● Flexible Payout Frequency The intervals of paper are always an investor's decisions based on their cash flow requirement or the lifestyle they want to lead. Whether you prefer a monthly pension to cover your daily expenses or annual payouts for any large expense, most annuity plans allow customisation as necessary. ● Return of Purchase Price Option There are some annuity plans that include the ROP or Return of Purchase Price feature. This feature states that the total premium invested is returned to the nominee when the investor passes away. Such plans offer slightly lower regular payouts in exchange for principal protection. This also makes it ideal for individuals who want to leave a financial legacy while still receiving a steady income. ● Lifetime or Fixed Term Payouts When choosing an annuity plan, you have the option to choose between: Lifetime Annuity: Provides guaranteed income for your entire life. Fixed-Term Annuity (e.g., 10 or 20 years): Pays a fixed amount for a predefined period. Remember that selecting a fixed-term payout helps align income with specific goals, like funding education for grandchildren. On the other hand, lifetime payouts protect against outliving your savings. ● Joint Life Annuity Option With this option, payouts continue to your spouse (or another named person) even after your death. In this case, the surviving partner receives the same or a slightly reduced pension. This ensures financial security for joint individuals without interruption. These features reflect a practical annuity definition , which emphasises predictability, stability, and customisation. What are the different types of annuities? The annuity market in India was USD 5.3 billion in 2024 and is projected to double to over USD 10 billion by 2032. This can be possible due to the availability of different types of annuities . So here are the details on different annuity types: ● Immediate Annuities In this type, you invest a lump sum amount and start receiving the payouts immediately without having any accumulation phase. This is ideal for people who are near their retirement age or have already retired and need instant income and financial security. While these offer limited flexibility (e.g., no easy withdrawals or corpus growth), they guarantee predictable cash flow. For example, HDFC Life’s Smart Pension Plus offers immediate payout options designed for retirees who prefer simplicity over complexity. ● Deferred Annuities For young or middle-aged individuals who want to plan their finances earlier, this plan is feasible. This is because the money grows first, and the payouts start later in this case. You can tailor the premium amount, contribution duration, and payout start date to match your retirement goals. The flexibility ensures you accumulate a meaningful corpus when it matters most. ● Fixed Annuity This scheme offers guaranteed payouts at fixed interest rates that are locked in at inception. It is best for conservative investors who value stability and predictability. Market fluctuations do not impact your returns, ensuring a steady income stream. For example, fixed annuities are suitable for retirees who want to keep their money secured against market volatility. ● Variable Annuity Annuity payouts significantly depend on the performance of market-linked investments. Here is how it is done: - Accumulation Phase This phase is when you start investing as well as accumulating cash, commencing from the date when you pay the premium for the first time. - Vesting Phase This is the date from when you will start getting the benefits of the annuity policy in terms of regular pensions. It is crucial to understand that variable annuities suit financially savvy investors seeking market-linked growth and willing to track performance actively. Go through the following table to get a detailed comparison of different annuity types. Each type further refines the annuity meaning , depending on your risk profile, timeline, and goals. Annuity Type Nature of Income Best Suited For Immediate Annuity Start instantly after retirement Retirees requiring quick and regular income Deferred Annuity It starts later, after the accumulation of funds Young and middle-aged individuals and long-term financial planners Fixed Annuity Guarantees fixed payout to investors Investors with low-risk appetite Arable Annuity Market-linked income way Market experienced investors Benefits of Various Types of Annuity Different types of annuities offer you different advantages that have been discussed in detail below: ● Benefits of Immediate Annuities For those who are planning to retire soon or who are getting a sizable payment, such as a policy maturity, immediate annuities begin paying out as soon as you invest a lump sum. They remove concerns about market volatility by offering a fixed monthly income. This scheme also provides peace of mind because there is no need to handle money or make additional judgments. Retirees who want immediate income or those looking for a steady, lifetime payout free from the hassle of constant investing decisions may particularly benefit from this. For instance, a 60-year-old retiree receives Rs. 7,200 monthly from Rs. 12 lakh, ensuring no gap in income right after retirement. ● Benefits of Deferred Annuities Deferred annuities are ideal for long-term retirement planning because they let you build money over time before payouts start. During the accumulation period, you can invest gradually and benefit from tax-deferred growth. Usually starting at a selected retirement age, payouts have the potential to yield larger profits. People in their 30s to 50s who want to guarantee future income can benefit from these annuities. Additionally, they provide flexibility, nominee death benefits, and customisation choices to meet your risk tolerance and financial objectives. For example, a 40-year-old invests Rs. 5,000 monthly; by age 60, the corpus, boosted through compounding, supports higher pension payouts. How Do the Different Types of Annuities Function? Different annuities functions as per their features that are discussed in detail below: ● Life Annuity This annuity provides a consistent income for the duration of your life, ending when you pass away and leaving no inheritance for your heirs. It provides a longevity guarantee at the expense of leaving no legacy, making it perfect for anyone looking to protect themselves from outliving their wealth. ● Life Annuity with Refund of Purchase Amount In this case, your income is guaranteed for as long as you live, and the financial institution or insurance company reimburses your nominee for your initial investment if you die before your time. It strikes a balance between security and legacy planning by combining a death benefit with lifetime income. ● Annuity Paid for Set Period (Fixed Term Annuity) Regardless of your survival, this guarantees set rewards for a predetermined period (for example, 10–20 years). It provides financial stability and is effective for people handling legacy funds or fixed expenditures like EMIs. ● Annuity Linked to Inflation (Inflation-Indexed Annuity) This annuity protects your buying power with yearly increases based on inflation (CPI or another index). Over time, it aids in preserving real income because of India's CPI inflation, which is around 2.59% as of May 2025. ● Annuity for Surviving Joint Life (Joint Life Last Survivor Annuity) Mainly intended for couples, this scheme ensures continuous income until both annuitants have gone away by paying you and continuing, in whole or in part, to your spouse after your death. ● Joint Life Annuity with Refund of Initial Payment This annuity strikes a balance between continuing assistance and legacy preservation by combining joint-life continuity with a refund provision. It provides lifetime income to two individuals and refunds the purchase price to beneficiaries after both pass away. Who Should Buy Annuity Plan? An annuity plan is suitable for individuals who: ● Are retiring without a pension and want a steady income source after retirement. ● Prefer guaranteed returns over market-linked investments and are risk-averse. ● Seek financial stability to cover regular expenses like bills, healthcare, and daily needs. ● Want lifetime income without worrying about market fluctuations or fund depletion. ● Plan to live independently, especially in the absence of family financial support. ● Have a lump sum from savings, inheritance, or retirement funds and want to convert it into monthly payouts. For instance, a retired couple with no pension can opt for a joint-life annuity to ensure income for both lives. Understanding what is annuity plan is helps align product features with real-life financial goals. When is the Right Time to Buy an Annuity Plan? Your life stage, interest rates, and personal objectives all play a crucial role in finalising when you should buy an annuity. Look at these details: ● Financial consultants often advise purchasing between the ages of 50 and 70, when you are getting close to retirement and have funds available to turn into guaranteed income. ● Age matters significantly since insurers anticipate shorter lifespans and older purchasers earn larger rewards. Annuity rates, for instance, can increase from almost 6.6% at age 60 to almost 11.6% at age 70. ● Timing is also influenced by interest rates. Higher bond yields immediately increase annuity payouts, so a rising rate environment (e.g., above 7 %) may signal a good purchase window. What are the Tax Implications of Annuities? Tax Implications in Income Tax Act 1961 1 Under Sections 80C, 80CCC, and 80CCD, annuity contributions are tax deductible up to Rs. 1.5 lakh annually. Further benefit of deferred annuities is tax deferral, which allows your money to grow tax-free until payouts start. Once payouts start, annuity income is considered 'Income from Other Sources' (deferred plans) or 'Salaries' (immediate or employer-funded annuities) and taxed as per your income slab. A standard deduction of Rs. 50,000 (or actual income received, whichever is less) can also be deducted from your annuity taxable income. For example, if you receive Rs. 1.2 lakh annually from an annuity, it will be taxed as per your income slab, but you can claim a Rs. 50,000 standard deduction under current tax rules. Benefits of Annuity plans The benefits of annuity plans are as follows: Guaranteed Income Annuities provide a steady stream of income post retirement, which turns out to be helpful in providing financial stability by covering living expenses through the guaranteed payout. Lifetime Income Some annuity plans also offer a lifetime income option, which ensures that you receive payouts for the rest of your remaining lifespan, irrespective of how long you go on to live. This removes the risk of outliving your annuity savings. Creditor Protection In certain scenarios, annuities can also offer protection from creditors, thus helping you safeguard your assets from potential financial risks. Death Benefits Some types of annuities offer death benefits as well, which provide a financial benefit for your nominees by assuring them guaranteed payments after your demise. Tax-Deferred Growth Earnings from your annuity are tax-deferred until you start making withdrawals. This allows your investment to rise faster when compared to investments whose earnings keep getting taxed. Multiple Payout Options Annuities allow multiple payout options, like periodic or lump-sum withdrawals, or even a combination of both of them, thus giving you the flexibility to manage your finances upon retirement. No Contribution Limits Annuities typically involve no contribution limits, thus allowing you to invest bigger sums, to secure your post-retirement income. Example of an annuity A simple example of an annuity can be in the form of NPS (National Pension System). An annuity in NPS refers to a regular income that you receive after the retirement age of 60. Given that it is mandatory to buy an annuity as a component of NPS , this ensures a steady and guaranteed income for you after retirement. As per PFRDA's rules, a minimum of 40% of your total accumulated NPS corpus has to be compulsorily used towards the purchase of an annuity. The remaining 60% of the NPS corpus is free to be withdrawn tax-free and in a lump sum. What is the Surrender Period? The surrender period is the lock-in time frame of an annuity during which you cannot fully or partially withdraw the funds without incurring a penalty. It generally lasts 5–10 years, depending on the annuity terms. Early exit during this period leads to surrender charges, often starting at 7% – 10% in the first year and decreasing by about 1% annually. For example, if you withdraw Rs. 1 lakh in year 1, you could face a Rs. 10,000 fee; by year 5, the fee might drop to Rs. 3,000. These charges compensate insurers for upfront costs and discourage premature exits. Surrender period in annuity matters since: ● It lowers your withdrawal amount significantly ● Influences your decision when selecting an annuity. It is important to choose one with surrender terms that align with your cash flow needs.

You can use the annuity payout for many purposes, from covering your daily expenses to big post retirement goals. FAQs on What is Annuity Q. How does an annuity plan work?

Increase investment in ULIPs with a focus on wealth accumulation and life coverage. Consider adding funds that offer tax benefits under Section 80C. 50s Shift focus towards debt and balanced funds to preserve capital and ensure steady growth.

The intrinsic value of the options issued unde r the above referred schemes is ‘Nil’ as the exercise price of the option was the same as fair value of the underlying share on the grant date and accor dingly, no expen ses are recognised in the books. xv) Had the Company follow ed the fair value method for valuing its options, the charge to the Revenue Account/Prof it & Loss Account for the year would have been aggregated to Rs. 493,610 thousands (Previo us year ende d March 31, 2022 Rs. 226,406 thousands) and the profit after tax would have been lower by Rs. 291,605 thousands (Previo us year ende d March 31, 2022 Rs. 131,965 thousands). Consequent ly, the Company’s basic and diluted earnings per share would have been Rs. 6.24 and Rs. 6.24 respectively (Previous year: Rs. 5.84 and Rs. 5.84 respectively). 20 Method of computation of fair value of options: The fair value of options has been calculated using the Black-Scholes model. The key assumptions used in Black-Scholes model for calculating fair value of options as on the date of grant are as follows: Assumptions Basis of Assumptions Risk free interest rate Determined basis G -sec yield on the grant date corresponding to maturity period equal to expected life of options Expected life of options (years) Average of the weighted average time to vesting and the contractual life of options Expected volatility Based on the historical stock prices using annualized standard deviation of daily change in stock price Expected dividend yield Calculated based on recent rate of dividend de clared The ESOS scheme -wise ranges of values for the assumptions are as follows: As at March 31, 2022 ESOS Scheme Risk Free Interest Rate Range Expected Life Range Expected Volatility Range Expected Dividend Yield ESOS 2012 8.19% - 8.74% 1.37 - 3.45 years 30.44% - 36.53% 0.00% ESOS 2014 7.73% - 8.28% 1.75 - 3.75 years 33.23% - 37.15% 1.06% ESOS 2015 7.41% - 7.58% 1.75 - 3.75 years 34.21% - 38.38% 1.04% ESOS 2016 6.57% - 6.80% 1.75 - 3.75 years 10.00% 0.88% ESOS 2017 6.79% - 7.30% 1.75 - 3.75 years 28.96% 0.74% ESOS (Trust) 2017 6.79% - 7.30% 1.75 - 3.75 years 28.96% 0.74% ESOS 2018 8.02% - 8.15% 1.74 – 3.74 years 29.09% 0.40% ESOS 2019 4.43% - 6.34% 1.68 – 5.09 years 29.12% - 39.73% 0.23% to 0.41% ESOS 2022 7.13% - 7.53% 2.07 – 5.08 years 27.7 5% - 33.47% 0.28% to 0.32% As at March 31, 2022 ESOS Scheme Risk Free Interest Rate Range Expected Life Range Expected Volatility Expected Dividend Yield ESOS 2012 8.19% - 8.74% 1.37 - 3.45 years 30.44% - 36.53% 0.00% ESOS 2014 7.73% - 8.28% 1.75 - 3.75 years 33.23% - 37.15% 1.06% ESOS 2015 7.41% - 7.58% 1.75 - 3.75 years 34.21% - 38.38% 1.04% ESOS 2016 6.57% - 6.80% 1.75 - 3.75 years 10.00% 0.88% ESOS 2017 6.79% - 7.30% 1.75 - 3.75 years 28.96% 0.74% ESOS (Trust) 2017 6.79% - 7.30% 1.75 - 3.75 years 28.96% 0.74% ESOS 2018 8.02% - 8.15% 1.74 – 3.74 years 29.09% 0.40% ESOS 2019 4.43% - 6.34% 1.68 – 5.09 years 29.12% - 39.73% 0.23% to 0.41% In the case of ESOS 2012, ESOS 2014 and ESOS 2015, volatility of a matured ente rprise in the industry which is listed on BSE has been used as a basis for estimation of expected volatility of options. In the case of ESOS 2016, the expected volatility has been assum ed at the rate of 10% since the company was unlisted as on the date of the grant. 21 In the case of ESOS 2017, ESOS (Trust) 2017, ESOS 2018 and ESOS 2019, the average of the volatility calculated on the available historical share prices of the company and its two peers, namely SBI Life Insurance Company Limited and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Limited has been considered. The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year ended March 31, 2022 is as follows: Grant dated October 20, 2022: Rs. 166.39 per option (Previous Year Rs.

The Company follows the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options granted to employees. The intrinsic value of the options issued under the above referred schemes is ‘Nil’ as the exercise price of the option was the same as fair value of the underlying share on the grant date and accordingly, no expenses are recognised in the books. Had the Company followed the fair value method for valuing its options, the charge to the Revenue Account/Profit & Loss Account for the year would have been aggregated to Rs. 493,610 thousands (Previo us year ende d March 31, 2022 Rs. 226,406 thousands) and the profit after tax would have been lower by Rs. 291,605 thousands (Previo us year ended March 31, 2022 Rs. 131,965 thousands). Consequent ly, the Company’s basic and diluted earnings per share would have been Rs. 6.24 and Rs. 6.24 respectively (Previous year: Rs. 5.84 and Rs. 5.84 respectively) Method of computation of fair value of options: The fair value of options has been calculated using the Black-Scholes model. The key assumptions used in Black-Scholes model for calculating fair value of options as on the date of grant across the vario us schemes are as follows: Assumptions Basis of Assumptions Risk free interest rate Determine d basis G -sec yield on the grant date corresponding to maturity period equal to expected life of options Expected life of options (years) Average of the weighted average time to vesting and the contractual life of options Expected volatility Based on the historical stock prices using annualized standard deviation of daily change in stock price Expected dividend yield Calculated based on recent rate of dividend declared The ESOS scheme -wise ranges of values for the assumptions are as follows: ESOS Scheme Risk Free Interest Rate Range Expe cted Life Range Expe cted Volatility Range Expe cted Dividend Yield ESOS 2012 8.19% - 8.74% 1.37 - 3.45 years 30.44% - 36.53% 0.00% ESOS 2014 7.73% - 8.28% 1.75 - 3.75 years 33.23% - 37.15% 1.06% ESOS 2015 7.41% - 7.58% 1.75 - 3.75 years 34.21% - 38.38% 1.04% ESOS 2016 6.57% - 6.80% 1.75 - 3.75 years 10.00% 0.88% ESOS 2017 6.79% - 7.30% 1.75 - 3.75 years 28.96% 0.74% ESOS (Trust) 2017 6.79% - 7.30% 1.75 - 3.75 years 28.96% 0.74% ESOS 2018 8.02% - 8.15% 1.74 – 3.74 years 29.09% 0.40% ESOS 2019 4.43% - 6.34% 1.68 – 5.09 years 29.12% - 39.73% 0.23% to 0.41% ESOS 2022 7.13% - 7.53% 2.07 – 5.08 years 27.75% - 33.47% 0.28% to 0.32% In the case of ESOS 2012, ESOS 2014 and ESOS 2015, volatility of a matured enterprise in the indus try which is listed on BSE has been used as a basis for estimation of expected volatility of options 57 In the case of ESOS 2016, the expected volatility has been assum ed at the rate of 10% since the company was unlisted as on the date of the grant. In the case of ESOS 2017, ESOS (Trust) 2017, ESOS 2018 and ESOS 2019, the average of the volatility calculated on the available historical share prices of the company and its two peers, namely SBI Life Insurance Company Limited and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Limited has been considered.

Electronic Debit i) NACH ECS facility for payment of premium started in LIC of India since March 2004. This is a facility by which premium is deducted by bank at pre-decided date and remitted to LIC. LIC of India has migrated all its existing policies registered under the ECS mode of premium deductions to NACH mode with effect from November 09, 2016. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has implemented an electronic payment service termed as National Automated Clearing House (NACH) is a funds clearing platform set up by NPCI similar to the existing ECS of RBI. RBI has mandated that all Merchants & Financial Institutions have to compulsorily migrate to NACH as ECS will be completely replaced by NACH. Under the NACH system, mandate forms are to be submitted as hard copies at the servicing branch of LIC. Conditions to avail this facility: NACH facility can be availed at the time of inception of the policy or later after completion of policy. In NACH Monthly mode, 5% extra premium charged under normal Monthly mode is waived. No receipts will be printed and dispatched for NACH Monthly mode policies. Premium paid certificate is issued twice a year by the Servicing Branch. NACH mode of payment can be opted for all in-force ULIP, Non-ULIP and Health policies as per plan conditions. NACH mode is not allowed for E-term Policies. To opt for NACH facility, the next premium must be due at least after 1 month from the date of exercising the option of NACH facility. Arrears of premiums cannot be collected through NACH. Under the policies registered under NACH mode, premium cannot be paid through any other payment channel except in case of NACH dishonour. If NACH debit to customer's bank is dishonoured, deduction will automatically stop for the further dues until the premiums that have fallen due are paid at LIC Branch / premium Point/LIC customer portal. Debit dates allowed are 7th, 15th, 22nd and 28th of the month. Debit dates are set automatically based on Date of commencement as follows: Date of Commencement Debit Date 1st to 7th of the month 7th of the same month 8th to 15th of the month 15th of the same month 16th to 22nd of the month 22nd of the same month 23rd to 28th of the month 28th of the same month How to avail this facility: Physical NACH: eNACH: NACH mandate form, duly signed by the account holder should be submitted along with cancelled cheque leaf/copy of passbook for validation of bank details of account holder. There will be a separate mandate for each policy. For NACH monthly mode cases, two instalments of premium will be collected for new policies. These will be in addition to the premium instalments for back dating cases. All NACH mandate forms submitted by customers at the LIC branch Office will be sent to LIC's NACH \"Sponsor Bank\" for scanning. Sponsor Bank will upload the scanned images on the NPCI platform. The Customer's Bank will validate the credentials from the image of the NACH mandate with the customer's details in the database of the Bank. If found valid, the customer's bank will accept the NACH mandate received from the customer and SMS conveying acceptance of the customer's NACH mandate for inclusion in the process of debiting all future premiums due under a given policy under NACH process will be sent. If the customer's bank detects any discrepancy in the image of the NACH mandate of the customer, customer will be informed of the rejection status through SMS on the registered mobile number in LIC's database. In such rejections, fresh NACH mandate is to be submitted to LIC Branch after taking necessary corrective action. For change in Bank details, fresh mandate form should be submitted to the servicing branch. Policy holder should ensure that sufficient funds are available in the bank account at the time of debit date and mandate is not dishonoured. Any dispute regarding dishonour should be taken up with the Customer's Bank only. This facility of easy premium payment can be availed of not only in respect of the policies of self but also on the policies issued on the lives of the spouse and children. After completion of Policy or submitting a form for mode change to eNACH in LIC Branch Office, an SMS will be sent to the Policyholder to validate the eNACH mandate. The Policyholder must click the link in the SMS sent by LIC of India or can visit this link to validate the eNACH mandate. The validation can be done through Debit Card, Net Banking and Aadhaar. The Banks eligible for eNACH and their validation types can be accessed through this link. NACH Dishonour: For the NACH dishonours, LIC sends a letter/SMS to the Policyholder as well as Email/SMS to the concerned Agent, intimating the dishonour with reason. If the reason is Insufficient funds or Account Closed , Dishonour charges of Rs. 125/- will be payable in addition to the due premiums and late fee (if applicable) with GST. If NACH is dishonoured twice for the reason Account Closed or No Such Account , no further Debit will happen unless fresh NACH mandate is submitted to LIC servicing Branch. ii) Direct Debit Direct Debit is a payment method where funds are automatically debited from the Policyholder's Bank Account to settle Renewal Premium dues. Once authorized, payments are processed on the debit date without requiring manual intervention, ensuring timely and hassle-free transactions. Currently, this mode is available to Policyholders who have completed their Policies online through IDBI Bank and Policy Bazaar. iii) Bill Pay (EBPP - Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment) Bill Pay, like Direct Debit, is a payment method where the Renewal Premium amount is debited from the Bank Account of the Policyholder. The Policyholder has to register his Policy on one of the Banks/Service Providers engaged by LIC of India for this purpose. Authorised Banks, Financial Institutions and Service Providers: ICICI Bank LIC Mutual Fund IndiaIdeas.com Limited (Bill Desk) This facility is absolutely free for all customers. No charges are to be paid to LIC/ Bank/ Service Provider for this facility. LIC pays service charges to the Bank/ Service provider as per pre-decided rates. Policies with Ordinary Mode of payment i.e. Yearly, Half-Yearly and Quarterly Mode of payment are allowed under this scheme. This facility can be availed only for in-force, Non-ULIP, Non-SSS Policies under Yearly, Half-Yearly, Quarterly Modes. Monthly mode policies and Policies registered under NACH are not eligible for registration under Bill Pay. Premium for ULIP, Health Insurance & E-Term policies cannot be paid through this mode. Policyholder has to register his/her policy in the Banker's/ Service Provider's website who will send the policies for Verification to LIC. The Policyholder holding LIC Credit Card and wish to register under Bill Pay option has to fill LIC Premium Payment Registration Form and submit it to LIC Cards Support, Axis Bank Ltd., Credit Card Operations, 4th Floor, NPCI Building No. I, Gigaplex Plot - ITS MIDC, Airoli Knowledge Park, Airoli, Navi Mumbai - 400 708. LIC Cards Customer care: 18002331100 After verifying the policies, LIC will send acceptance to the Banker/Service Provider. For any reason, if LIC rejects the registration (in case of lapsed policy, premium mismatch, particulars wrongly entered), the information regarding the same will be sent by the LIC/Bill Pay service provider to the Policyholder. In such case the policy is to be registered again. Old registration is treated as cancelled. Invoice from LIC will be generated 5 days before the due date which is valid up to the days of grace and sent to the Banker for uploading on their site. Premium can be paid either by giving standing instructions to the bank to debit the bank account/credit card account on a particular date (Auto Pay) or manually accepting the bill which can be paid by login to the banker's site and making the payment online (View & Pay). Receipt will be posted to the address mentioned in the policy records after two or three days of payment by LIC in case of old registrations only. W.e.f. July 2016, E-receipt is generated for all new registrations and sent to the registered Email ID. If premium is already paid through any other mode before receipt of the payment through EBPP or the premium amount does not match with premium required, the payment received through EBPP goes to refunds and the amount is refunded by LIC to Vendor/Bank for crediting the amount to the source bank/credit card account. It may take approximately 15 days. 3. Premium payments at Merchants LIC of India has authorised selected Development Officers, Senior Business Associates, Agents, Chief Organisers and Retired employees to collect renewal premium at LIFE Plus Points, LIFE Points, Premium Points and Bima Connect Offices.

Currently this margin is 5% of your Fund Value on the date of the Partial Withdrawal request or calculation. We may change this margin at any time without prior notification or approval from you.

Factors that Impact Life Insurance Premium Here are the factors to consider that impact the life insurance premium . Let us understand those factors in detail below: Sum Assured The sum assured is one of the most significant factors in determining the premium. Generally, the higher the sum assured, the higher the premium. When using an online insurance calculator, you'll notice that as the life coverage increases, so does the premium. It’s essential to choose a sum assured based on your liabilities, income, and financial needs to ensure you get adequate coverage without overpaying. Age Age plays a crucial role in determining the premium. As you age, the likelihood of health issues increases, leading to higher premiums. Starting your term insurance at a younger age can help you lock in a lower premium, as younger individuals tend to have fewer health risks compared to older individuals. Therefore, purchasing insurance early is more cost-effective. Gender In India, women generally pay lower premiums compared to men. This is due to the higher life expectancy of women, allowing them to continue their policies for longer, leading to lower premiums. However, as a woman’s age increases, her premium may rise accordingly. Medical History A person’s health is one of the most critical factors in determining insurance premiums. Most insurers require a medical examination to assess your health status, including any existing conditions or illnesses. If you have chronic or serious health issues, your premium is likely to be higher compared to someone in good health. Lifestyle Your lifestyle choices, such as smoking or drinking, can also impact your premium. A history of smoking or regular alcohol consumption raises the risk of health problems, leading to higher premiums. Conversely, maintaining a healthy lifestyle can help keep premiums lower. Occupation Although less significant, your occupation can influence your premium. Jobs that involve higher risk, such as construction or mining, may result in higher premiums due to the increased risk of injury or death. The impact of occupation on premiums can vary between insurers. Considering these factors when choosing your term insurance plan will help you make informed decisions and find the best policy for your needs. Should One Buy More Than One Life Insurance Policy? This decision completely depends upon your present financial health and future needs and goals. Whether you should have multiple policies depends on how much coverage you are seeking. More policies, on the one hand, can widen the coverage, but on the other, they can be a financial burden in your present circumstances. Having multiple policies works for those seeking to reduce risk and ensure that they have another policy to bank upon in case of delayed or rejected claim settlement from one. Still, managing multiple policies can be challenging, with risks of delayed or missed premium payments, leading to coverage lapses. Hence, it is best to assess the risks and rewards of this decision before going ahead with multiple policies.

Here are the ways to follow for filing a life insurance claim: Online claim To easily submit your claim online, go to the HDFC Life Claims section on the official website page. To begin the claim process, make sure to provide relevant details of the policyholder and nominee and submit it. Claim At Branch Download the claim form from the official website and submit it after filling it out with the correct details. Submit the other supporting documents at your nearest HDFC branch.

These documents include documents relating to hospitalisation, death certificates and others. KYC proofs should also be attached including an Aadhaar card, PAN card and other necessary documents. Alongside this, make sure to FIR papers if there is any accidental death or suicide or present a cancellation cheque. The documents are further reviewed and a settlement is issued from the respective insurance company. What Types of Death Are Not Covered by Life Insurance? To minimise the risk of rejection of death claims, let us look into the deaths that are excluded from life insurance coverage: Suicide The majority of life insurance companies in India do not include death by suicide during the initial years of term insurance policy. Thus, make sure to check out the inclusions and exclusions of the death insurance policy through the brochure of the plan you have opted for. From the date of opting for a term life policy, if the insured individual dies by suicide within 12 months, the insurance provider doesn't accept this claim. In other words, death caused by suicide is exempted from the insurance coverage during the first 12 months of purchasing the policy. However, if the policyholder dies by suicide during the exclusion period of insurance purchase, 80% of the paid premiums are then further returned to the nominee. Whereas, if the insured individual dies due to suicide after 12 months of purchase of the policy, the benefits of death are then further paid out to beneficiaries. Homicide Involving the Nominee Death claim is subjected to rejection if a policyholder is murdered and the nominee remains involved in the crime. Individual policyholders can only avail death benefits if the murder-related charges are dropped or if the nominee is surrendered. On the other hand, if the insured individual dies because of involvement in any criminal activity, there are no death benefits offered. However, if a criminal background check is conducted for the policyholder who dies due to some natural causes, then the death claim is passed on to the nominee. What happens if there is no nominee or if the nominee has already passed away at the time of the death claim? In case, if there is no nominee or if there is a sudden demise of the nominee during the time of death claim, proof of title or succession certificate is mandatory to issue from the court. The name of the person mentioned in the proof would then receive the claim amount. This kind of condition is often termed an 'Open Title' situation. If the claim is accepted but waiting for issuance of a certificate or proof, then the money is further kept on hold till submission of proof and payment. Claim in Case of Maturity To claim for the maturity of your life insurance plan, follow the detailed steps below: Contact with the insurer following any of the methods – call, email, website or in-person Submit all relevant details including PAN card, Aadhaar card, life insurance policy certificate and other documents with a cancellation cheque. The insurance company further goes through your submitted documents, reviews them and issues the settlement. How to Avoid Life Insurance Claim Rejection? Here are the things you must know to get your life insurance policy claim settled hassle-free: Do Not Hide Information Hiding information while choosing a life insurance plan is the most common reason for claim rejection. Some of the details you must not hide include the details of pre-existing diseases, age, occupation, consumption of alcohol, smoking habits, and others. On-Time Premium Payment Failing to pay your premium on time causes your policy to lapse. Even if you missed paying the premium by the due date, pay it within the grace period. Keep Nominee Information Up to Date Make sure to keep the information regarding the nominee updated as and when required. If you are single, mention your parent's name as a nominee. If you are married, you can add your spouse's or child’s name as a nominee. Do Not Avoid Medical Tests Do not avoid undergoing medical tests, as they provide insurers with an idea of your medical history and smoothen your insurance claim settlements.

The need of insurance for underprivileged section cannot be avoided as this section of society is more prone to many risks which ultimately leads to incapacity to face such uncertain situations. Hence, the role that micro insurance plays thus becomes inevitable. India has been seen to be a very exciting market and a pioneer in setting out the regulatory framework for Micro Insurance in the world. Microinsurance promises to support sustainable livelihoods of the poor. Liberalization of the insurance sector and Government Schemes has created new opportunities for Microinsurance to reach the vast majority of the poor, including those working in the informal sector. Even so, market penetration in Microinsurance is seen to be low in India. The market, so far, is seen to be largely supply driven. Among others, the product design, ease of underwriting, distribution, awareness creation, easy premium payment system, simple claims processing and understanding & use of new age technology would be key for success of the Microinsurance market. Distribution is the most critical link in the insurance value chain, especially for micro insurance where the customer is semi-literate or even illiterate, has limited financial resources and is largely inaccessible. Distribution becomes even more crucial in case of voluntary micro insurance since it also involves a ‘hard-selling’ element. On the other hand, due to the low insurance penetration among the low-income segment, there also lies a huge opportunity both in terms of business as well extending financial protection to those who need it the most. Various efforts have been made in the past to address the distribution challenge in micro insurance. The concept of ‘micro insurance agent’ introduced in 2005 was aimed at attracting more intermediaries to this space and leverage upon the connect enjoyed by grassroots organizations like cooperatives and SHGs with a large section of the low-income segment. Although this initiative succeeded in enrolling large numbers of micro insurance intermediaries, the volumes continue to remain modest – both in terms of premium collections as well as lives covered. The major challenges in microinsurance distribution are: - Small ticket size coupled with high transaction and service delivery costs. Absence of a business model that can attract good intermediaries. Capacity building of intermediaries. Lack of basic awareness and knowledge on how insurance works For further clarity please refer FAQs placed below. Micro Insurance Regulations 1. What are the governing provisions for Micro Insurance?

The need of insurance for underprivileged section cannot be avoided as this section of society is more prone to many risks which ultimately leads to incapacity to face such uncertain situations. Hence, the role that micro insurance plays thus becomes inevitable. India has been seen to be a very exciting market and a pioneer in setting out the regulatory framework for Micro Insurance in the world. Microinsurance promises to support sustainable livelihoods of the poor. Liberalization of the insurance sector and Government Schemes has created new opportunities for Microinsurance to reach the vast majority of the poor, including those working in the informal sector. Even so, market penetration in Microinsurance is seen to be low in India. The market, so far, is seen to be largely supply driven. Among others, the product design, ease of underwriting, distribution, awareness creation, easy premium payment system, simple claims processing and understanding & use of new age technology would be key for success of the Microinsurance market. Distribution is the most critical link in the insurance value chain, especially for micro insurance where the customer is semi-literate or even illiterate, has limited financial resources and is largely inaccessible. Distribution becomes even more crucial in case of voluntary micro insurance since it also involves a ‘hard-selling’ element. On the other hand, due to the low insurance penetration among the low-income segment, there also lies a huge opportunity both in terms of business as well extending financial protection to those who need it the most. Various efforts have been made in the past to address the distribution challenge in micro insurance. The concept of ‘micro insurance agent’ introduced in 2005 was aimed at attracting more intermediaries to this space and leverage upon the connect enjoyed by grassroots organizations like cooperatives and SHGs with a large section of the low-income segment. Although this initiative succeeded in enrolling large numbers of micro insurance intermediaries, the volumes continue to remain modest – both in terms of premium collections as well as lives covered. The major challenges in microinsurance distribution are: - Small ticket size coupled with high transaction and service delivery costs. Absence of a business model that can attract good intermediaries. Capacity building of intermediaries. Lack of basic awareness and knowledge on how insurance works For further clarity please refer FAQs placed below. Micro Insurance Regulations 1. What are the governing provisions for Micro Insurance?

What is continuous coverage? When a person is continuously Insured under a New India Premier Mediclaim Policy he is entitled to the benefit of Continuous Coverage.

However, the benefit of Continuous Coverage getting carried over for other Policies will not be available for following Coverage: OPD Treatments Maternity and Child Care Treatment for Infertility HIV/AIDS Psychiatric and Psychosomatic Disorders Obesity Treatments Can continuous coverage from other policies be carried over to new india premier mediclaim policy?

In case of change in Sum Insured during such uninterrupted coverage, the lowest Sum Insured would be reckoned for determining Continuous Coverage. For instance: A person was covered for four years under Mediclaim 2012 for a Sum Insured of INR Five lakhs, and carries over this Continuous Coverage to New India Premier Mediclaim in 2017. If there is a claim for a Pre-existing Condition in 2017 for an amount of INR Eight lakhs, the claim will be admitted only to the extent of INR five lakhs since this is the amount available under Continuous Coverage for more than three years.

The Sum Insured under the Policy is available for any or all the members covered for one or more claims during the tenure of the Policy. What sum insured should I choose? You are free to choose any Sum Insured from INR 15 lakhs, 25, lakhs, 50 lakhs and 100 lakhs.

The Policy is valid for a period of one year from the date of inception. The validity of the Policy will be mentioned in the Schedule attached to the Policy. The entire premium for the mentioned period will be payable at the commencement of the Policy period. When should i renew my present policy? In order to get all Continuity benefits under the Policy, you can renew the Policy within thirty days prior to the expiry of the present Policy. For instance, if Your Policy commences from 2nd October, 2011 date of expiry is usually on 1st October, 2012. You can renew Your Policy by paying the Renewal Premium from 1st September 2012 to 1st October 2012. What is continuity benefit? There are certain treatments which are payable only after the Insured Person is continuously covered for a specified period. For example, Cataract is covered only after twenty four months of Continuous Coverage. If an Insured took a Policy in October, 2016, does not renew it on time and takes a Policy only in December 2017, and renewed it on time in December 2018, any claim for Cataract would not become payable, because the Insured Person was not continuously covered for twenty four months. If, he had renewed the Policy in time in October 2017 and then in October 2018, then he would have been continuously covered for twenty four months and therefore his claim for Cataract in the Policy beginning from October 2018 would be payable. Therefore, you should always ensure that you pay your renewal Premium before Your Policy expires. Is there any grace period for renewal of the policy? Yes. If Your Policy is renewed within thirty days after the expiry of the previous Policy, then the Continuity Benefits would not be affected. But even if You renew Your Policy within thirty days after expiry of previous Policy, any Illness contracted or Injury sustained or Hospitalization commencing during the break in insurance is not covered. Therefore it is in Your own interest to see that you renew the Policy before it expires. Is there an age limit upto which the policy would be renewed? No. Your Policy can be renewed, as long as you pay the Renewal Premium before the date of expiry of the Policy. There is an age limit for taking a fresh Policy, but there is no age limit for renewal. However, if you do not renew Your Policy before the date of expiry or within thirty days of the date of expiry, the Policy may not be renewed, and only a fresh Policy could be issued, subject to Our underwriting rules. In such cases, it is possible that a fresh Policy could not be issued by Us. It is therefore in your interest to ensure that Your Policy is renewed before expiry. Can the insurance company refuse to renew the policy? We may refuse to renew the Policy only under instances such as fraud, misrepresentation or non-disclosure of material facts or non-cooperation by You or any one acting on Your behalf in obtaining insurance or subsequently in relation thereto. If we discontinue selling this Policy, it will not be possible to renew this Policy on the same terms and conditions. In such a case you shall, however, have the option for renewal under any similar Policy being issued by the Company as on that date, provided the benefits payable shall be subject to the terms contained in such other Policy. In case of revision or modification or withdrawal of the Policy a notice will be provided to You 90 days before such revision or modification or withdrawal. Renewal can also be refused if the Policy is not renewed before expiry of the Policy or within the Grace Period. Can I make a claim immediately after taking a policy?

However, claims for Hospitalization due to Accidents occurring even during the first thirty days are payable.

    "content": "Breadcrumb Home Customer Services Policy Guidelines & Helpline Policy Guidelines & Helpline Guidelines For Policy Holders We welcome you as a policyholder and as a prospective customer to our customer service section. This section will guide you through the various intricacies of a life insurance contract and the facts that you must know to make the best out of your life insurance policy. Please read our guidelines carefully. Your Policy Bond And Its Safety Your Policy Number Policy Conditions Alterations In Policy If Your Policy Is Lost Your Contact Address – Keep Us Posted Without Fail Admission Of Age Nomination Assignment When To Pay The Premiums Grace Period For Premium Payment How And Where To Pay The Premiums Policy Status – Where Available Revival Of Lapsed Policies Availing Loans On Policies Surrender Value Maturity, Survival Benefits, Disability And Death Claims Policies Under Salary Savings Scheme Helpline Your Policy Bond And Its Safety The policy bond is the document that is given to you after we accept your proposal for insurance. The risk coverage commences after acceptance of your proposal and the conditions and privileges of your policy are mentioned in the policy bond. This is an important document which would be referred to for various servicing interactions with you – Keep the policy bond safe. It will be required at the time of settlement of claims on the policy. You will also require it if you are availing a loan or want to assign the policy. Inform your spouse/Parents/Children as to where the policy is kept. In case you are handing over the policy bond to any person or office, please take a written acknowledgement. Keep a Photostat copy of the policy for your reference. Your Policy Number The policy number is consisting of nine digits and can be found at the top left hand corner of the schedule of your policy bond. This is a unique identification number that distinguishes your policies from other policies and will remain unchanged throughout the lifetime of the policy. Remember to quote the policy number every time in your correspondence, as it helps us to locate your records for reference. Policy Conditions Every policy is taken for different types of needs; therefore the conditions for your policy will vary according to the Plan and Term of the policy. The policy schedule contains on the first page of your policy, like the ones mentioned above as well as other information like nominee, your address etc. It also shows the date of commencement of your policy, date of birth, date of maturity, due dates and months in which the renewal premiums are to be paid etc. The second page onwards carries the various policy conditions like risk coverage, additional risks coverage if opted for, standard benefits that are available for all policies, accident benefit if opted for, exclusion of risks if any and other conditions that govern the contract of insurance. Apart from death benefits there are other standard benefits and benefits opted by the policyholder, which you might want to familiarize yourself with ( Click here to know more about various types of policy conditions and their implications). Alterations In Policy There may be instances when you would like to make alterations in your policy like change of premium payment mode, reduction in premium paying term etc. Your applications may be given in writing to the branch that services your policy for our further action. There are different types of alterations that are allowed on our life insurance policies( Click here to know more about alterations). If Your Policy Is Lost Kindly make a thorough search before concluding that you have lost the policy bond. Look for the same within your residence, among your investment papers, at your office and even with your agent to whom you might have entrusted the document for some reason. It could have been even pledged with LIC/any other financial institution for availing a loan by you. LIC retains the policy bond when you go in for a loan against the policy. Make sure that the document you are searching is not one that has already been assigned to LIC, or to another financial institution. If the policy bond is partially destroyed due to natural causes like, fire, flood, etc, the remaining portion may be returned as evidence of loss of policy to LIC, while applying for a duplicate policy. In case you are sure that the policy bond is untraceable due to unknown causes, there is a simple procedure to comply with while applying for the duplicate policy at the branch that services your policy ( Click here to know about obtaining duplicate policies). Your Contact Address – Keep Us Posted Without Fail Your address is very important for us. Without your latest address we would not be in a position to contact you for any service offering. We would not like to keep any benefit that is due to you pending for want of this very important information. Whenever you shift residences, please inform the new address to us. Otherwise any communication we send to you, like premium notices, discharge vouchers for maturity and survival benefits etc., will get delayed in reaching you. LIC provides for change of addresses, inclusion of telephone numbers, mobile numbers and email addresses in your contact addresses information. Kindly inform your servicing branch to incorporate the same in your policy records. Admission Of Age Check your policy bond and see if your date of birth is correctly given therein. This is one of the factors on which the premiums you pay for your policy is arrived at. This would also form the basis of all future policies you might avail from us. In case your earlier policies do not have your date of birth incorporated and you do have a date of birth certificate issued by the competent authority, you may send an attested copy of the same to us, with a request to admit your age ( Click here to find out the certificates of age that LIC accepts.) Nomination Ensure that the nominees name is correctly incorporated in the policy bond. You may change the nomination in your policy any time during the lifetime of the policy In case you have not included the name of the nominee till now, please do not delay; inform us your nomination immediately. Kindly note that the change of nomination has to be done in the branch that services your policy. The nominee is the person to whom the insurance claim amounts would be payable, in case anything unfortunate within the purview of the policy conditions happens to you. The policy is usually taken by you to benefit your family – nominate the persons who’ll have the welfare of your family in your absence; the usual preferences being spouse and children. You may nominate even minors like your children, in which case you have to name another person who’ll have the welfare of the minor children, as an appointee( Click here to know more about nomination). Assignment In case you are raising a loan against your policy from LIC or any other financial institution, your policy would have to be assigned to LIC or the financial institution. When you assign the policy the title of the policy is shifted from your name to that of the institution. The policy would be reassigned to you on the repayment of the loan. A fresh nomination should be done after reassignment of the policy. Assignment of policies can be done even when a loan is not required or for some special purposes (To learn more about assignment Click here ). When To Pay The Premiums Remember to pay your premium in time, even if our notices do not reach you. There may be a postal delay. LIC usually sends premium notices one month in advance to the due month of the premium. The due months of the premium are given in front page of the Policy bond. In case you have not paid the premium within the due date there is still time for you to make the payments without payment of interest on the premium. This period is called the grace period. (With the exception of some plans) The grace period for policies where the premium payment mode is monthly is 15 days from the due date. The grace period for policies where the premium payment mode is quarterly, half-yearly or yearly is one month but not less than30 days. How And Where To Pay The Premiums By cash, local cheque (subject to realization of cheque), Demand Draft at Branch Office. You can pay your premiums at any of our Branches as 100% of our Branches are networked. A policyholder can pay premium online without visiting the servicing branch. The option is available in CUSTOMER PORTAL under Online Payments Tab. Policyholder can also pay it by using PAY DIRECT option after keying in relevant information like Policy number, Insurance Premium, Date of Birth, Mobile number and Email id. E-Receipt will be sent to the email id registered by the policyholder and it will also be available in his/her Portal account. LIC premiums can be paid by using Net Banking accounts with following banks: For Authorized Banks Click Here. Other modes of payment are Debit-Cards (VISA/MASTER/RUPAY), Wallets, Payment banks, UPI and Credit cards (AMEX/VISA/MASTER/RUPAY). There are no charges for payment through Debit-card, Net-banking, Wallet and UPI. Payments through Credit Cards are subject to a \"Convenience fee\". The \"Convenience Fee\" applicable is entirely absorbed by LIC. The premium receipt for the payment through Portal/Pay Direct can be printed online and will also be e-mailed to the Policy Holder at the same time. Simultaneously successful/unsuccessful transaction message will be flashed. Policy holder can also opt for payment of premium through NACH mode where mandate to debit the premium from bank account as and when due is to be submitted. Detailed procedure is given under F&Q section. Policy Status – Where Available Status of your policy indicates if your policy is in force or has lapsed due to non-payment of premium. It also provides other important information with respect to your policy, for your reference. The status of your policy is available at the branch that services your policies. It is also available through our Interactive Voice Response Systems in select cities ( Click here to find out if your city is covered). In cities connected by our computerized networks the status will be available in any of the branches. Now the policy status of policies being serviced in the cities connected by network are also available through Internet ( Click here to register for these services). In select cities online touch screen kiosks are also provided where you can view your policy status. Revival Of Lapsed Policies If your policy has lapsed due to non-payment of premiums within the due date, the terms and conditions of the policy contract are rendered void, till you revive your policy. A lapsed policy has to be revived by payment of the accumulated premiums with interest as well as giving the health requirements as required . ( Click here for knowing more about the revival procedure and the different types of revival allowed) Always keep your policy in force to ensure that your family gets their financial protection assured by your policy. However certain concessions dependent on the term for which you have paid the premiums are available with the exception of some plans for claims concession.( Click here to know the concessions for delayed premium payment and for claims during the lapsed period). Availing Loans On Policies Many of our plans are of endowment type and you would be allowed to raise a loan against your policy should you require funds. You repay the loan with interest or continue paying the interest and allow the loan to be deducted at the time of the claim payments. Further loans on policies are also allowed after deduction of earlier out standings ( Click here to find out more about loans on policies). Most financial institutions too allow loans against LIC policies based on the value LIC quotes on request from you. Surrender Value This is the value which is the amount payable to you should you decide to discontinue the policy and encash the same from LIC. Surrender value is payable only after three full years premiums are paid to LIC. More over if it is a participating policy the Bonus get attached to it as per prevalent rules. Surrender of policy is not recommended since the surrender value would always be proportionately low. Should you decide to go in for another insurance at this stage further insurance would be available to you at a much higher premium because your age would have advanced since taking out the earlier policy. Therefore retention of earlier policies and continuation of all policies without allowing them to lapse is the best strategy for continuing life insurance protection. Maturity, Survival Benefits, Disability And Death Claims: When your Survival Benefits (For Money back policies) or maturity benefits are due, we send intimations to you in advance. However, if the survival benefit amount is less than or equal to Rs.500,000/- the same will be sent to you directly without policy or discharge forms with a few exceptions. If such intimations have not come to you before the due date kindly inform us so that we may take necessary action ( Click here to know about the claims procedure) Policies Under Salary Savings Scheme If you have taken your policy under salary Saving Scheme please read the following suggestions : For each Salary Savings Scheme Policy your employer deducts the premium from your salary and sends a consolidated cheque for all the policies of the employees to a designated Branch of LIC, where all the policy files are maintained. You can find out which Branch of LIC your policy file will be serviced either from your Agent or from the pay roll department of your employer. You will need to know which branch of LIC services your policy because you will require their help in getting your Maturity/Survival Benefits, for any alterations like change of address and for availing loans etc. In case you are in a transferable job please inform the designated Branch of LIC about your new place of posting. After you join your new place of posting please ask your employer the LIC Branch where the premiums are being remitted by your office there and inform the LIC Branch which was servicing you earlier so that your policy files can be transferred. This way your records will be at correct place and will receive the services from us like maturity, in time. In case you are leaving your employer for a new job or joining another firm, you have the facility to either continue the policy under the Salary Savings Scheme of your new firm or to convert the payment mode into quarterly, half yearly or yearly mode. Always ensure the continuity of premium payments to avoid frequent revivals of policy. This may become a cumbersome process for a person who is in a transferable job. Please do not send any installments directly to us. Your premium must come through your employer only. We do not have systems to adjust single installments received from our policy holders. Otherwise please convert the mode into quarterly, halfyearly, or yearly and pay directly. This way you also get a discount on the premium payable. Leave a permanent local address with us so that we can reach you wherever you are even after many years. Disclaimer The information contained herein is only to guide you and does not purport to be binding on either party. The contractual implications of your policy will be subject to the terms and conditions of your proposal and the policy document issued to you. They may be also subject to the rules and regulations of the corporation notified from time to time which may be subject to revision and change. The contract will also be subject to the prevailing laws of the country. Helpline To ensure that you get the best out of your policy please read our guidelines carefully. Keep the policy bond safe. It will be required at the time of maturity or Survival Benefit. You will also require it if you are availing a loan or want to assign ypur policy. Inform your spouse/Parents/Children as to where the policy is kept. When you shift residences, please inform the new address to us. Otherwise any communication we send to you, like premium notices, discharge vouchers, etc., will get delayed in reaching you. Ensure that the nominees name is correctly incorporated in the policy bond. Remember to pay your premium in time. Due months in which premium is due is given in policy bond. Check your policy bond and see if your date of birth is correctly given therein. In case you are handing over the policy bond to any person or office, including the LIC office please take a written acknowledgement. When your Survival Benefits (For Money back policies) or maturity benefits are due, we send intimations to your three months in advance. If such intimations have not come to your even within one month of the due date kindly inform us so that we may take necessary action. When in doubt call your agent or the Branch from where you took the policy. Our Branches are our Operating Units. Hence, for any servicing matter, contact the Servicing Branch of your policy. However, for obtaining general information, you can contact any of the Branches of LIC. Website Last modified date : Tue, 01 Apr 2025 10:31:17 +0000",
