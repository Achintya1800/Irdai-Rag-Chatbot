In India, we have a variety of insurance plans to suit every need. The simplest plans are Term insurance plans, in which there is a death benefit but no maturity benefits. In Term Insurance, the insurer promises to pay the beneficiaries a lump sum amount in the event of the insured person's death. Some Term insurance plans nowadays also offer to give back the premiums you pay on surviving the policy period; these are called Term insurance with return of premium plans. Other life insurance plans in India include Endowment Insurance plans, Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs), Moneyback Insurance plans, Whole life insurance plans, Group life insurance, Child Insurance Plans and Retirement Insurance Plans. 5 What are the factors that affect life insurance premium? The main factor influencing the life insurance premiums of a policyholder is their age. Younger persons are generally considered healthy and unlikely to contract illnesses or pass away suddenly; hence younger people attract lower insurance premiums. Gender is another factor that determines the premium amount as proven scientific and statistical evidence points to women likely to live an average of 5 years more than men. Consequently, since women are perceived to avail of policies for a longer tenure, they can avail of lower premiums. Medical records play a crucial factor in deciding the premium as well, since life insurance policies typically come with an underwriting process that includes a thorough medical exam of the policyholder. Any red flags concerning physical health and potential illnesses can have an impact on the amount of premium to be paid. Family history is important as certain hereditary diseases could be passed on to the policyholder. The family's medical history plays a part in revealing these patterns and can influence the amount of premium. Smoking and drinking, which are considered harmful to health and can impact your longevity, also influence the amount of premium to be paid. Professions and lifestyles can also impact the life insurance premium. Persons working in professions considered dangerous like mining, oil and gas and fisheries, and indulging in risk taking activities like mountaineering can attract higher premiums. 6 What types of death are not covered by life insurance? While deaths due to accidents are covered by life insurance, there are certain exceptions. Accidental death if the insured is involved in any criminal activity or if death occurs due to intoxication or drugs are not covered by term life insurance plans. Accidental deaths while the insured was engaged in adventure sports like sky diving and bungee jumping are also not covered by such plans. Death benefits for suicide are generally made at the discretion of insurance companies. Usually, beneficiaries are entitled to 80 per cent of amount accumulated from premiums paid in case of a non-linked plan, and 100 per cent in the case of a linked plan, if the insured dies by suicide within the initial 12 months. Term insurance plans do not cover death occurring from self-inflicted injuries, or due to illnesses like sexually transmitted diseases like HIV/AIDS. Death due to alcohol or drug abuse is also not covered by term plans, nor is homicide where the policy holder is murdered by the nominee for money. Death due to an existing illness that has not been disclosed at the time of purchasing the plan is also not covered by term life insurance plans.
